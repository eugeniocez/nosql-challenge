For this section, you will need to set up your MongoDB database and Jupyter Notebook environment using the provided `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` notebook.

1. Open the `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up your MongoDB database and establish a connection with Jupyter Notebook.

## Part 2: Update the Database

Once your database and notebook environment are set up, you will update the database with any necessary changes or additions.
